## Git main commands

`git init` starts a new git repository (only once, when the project is created!!!! ðŸ¤¬)

`git status` checks if the rep is dirty (changes not commited)

`git add <file_name>` adds the file to the next commit

`git commit -m "good message that describes the commit"` take picture of the current code

`git push origin master` push to remote the commited code
